# TL;DR

Under GNU/Linux, with a user having the rights to run docker commands and the possibility to install Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
# check docker access
$ docker ps
# if there is no error here, then proceed with the installation using pip
$ pip install aymara
$ python
>>> import aymara.lima
>>> l = aymara.lima.Client(host='localhost', port='8080')
>>> sentences = l.analyzeText('Hello, World!', lang='eng', pipeline='deep')
>>> print(sentences[0][0].lemma)
hello
>>> print(sentences.conll())
# sent_id = 1
# text = Hello, World!
1       Hello   hello   PROPN   _       _       2       Dummy   _       Len=5|NE=Person.PERSON|Pos=1|SpaceAfter=No

# Introducing LIMA

LIMA is a multilingual linguistic analyzer developed by the [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/en), [LASTI laboratory](http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm) (French acronym for Text and Image Semantic Analysis Laboratory). LIMA is available under a dual licensing model, AGPL and commercial.

LIMA has [state of the art performance for more than 60 languages](https://github.com/aymara/lima-models/blob/master/eval.md) thanks to its recent deep learning (neural network) based modules. But it includes also a very powerful rules based mechanism called ModEx allowing to quickly extract information (entities, relations, eventsâ€¦) in new domains where annotated data does not exist.

For more information, installation instructions and documentation, please refer to [the LIMA Wiki](https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki).
